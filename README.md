# Jiseti â€“ Civic Engagement Platform

# Description
Jiseti is a full-stack web application that empowers citizens to report corruption-related incidents (**red-flags**) or request urgent government action (**interventions**). It promotes **transparency and accountability** by allowing administrators to track, verify, and update the status of reports, while citizens remain informed throughout the process. The platform bridges the gap in Africaâ€™s development challenges by providing an accessible way to report corruption, request interventions (e.g., bad roads, collapsed bridges, flooding), and track progress to hold authorities accountable. Users can submit reports with supporting evidence, and administrators oversee case statuses.

## ðŸš¨ Problem Statement
Corruption and poor service delivery are key challenges to Africaâ€™s development. Citizens often lack transparent and accessible platforms to:
- Report corruption,
- Request interventions (e.g., bad roads, collapsed bridges, flooding),
- Track progress and hold authorities accountable.

**Jiseti** bridges this gap by enabling citizens to submit reports with supporting evidence, while administrators oversee cases and update statuses.
