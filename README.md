# Jiseti â€“ Civic Engagement Platform

Jiseti is a full-stack web application that empowers citizens to report corruption-related incidents (**red-flags**) or request urgent government action (**interventions**).  
It promotes **transparency and accountability** by allowing administrators to track, verify, and update the status of reports, while citizens remain informed throughout the process.

## ðŸš¨ Problem Statement
Corruption and poor service delivery are key challenges to Africaâ€™s development. Citizens often lack transparent and accessible platforms to:
- Report corruption,
- Request interventions (e.g., bad roads, collapsed bridges, flooding),
- Track progress and hold authorities accountable.

**Jiseti** bridges this gap by enabling citizens to submit reports with supporting evidence, while administrators oversee cases and update statuses.
